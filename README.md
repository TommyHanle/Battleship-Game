Welcome to Battleship!

Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 10x10 grid. Players take turns placing ships on their own board and trying to sink their opponent's ships by guessing the coordinates of the ships' locations. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.
