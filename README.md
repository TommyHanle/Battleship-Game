Welcome to Battleship!

Battleship is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 10x10 grid. Players take turns placing ships on their own board and trying to sink their opponent's ships by guessing the coordinates of the ships' locations. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

This repository contains the code for a web-based implementation of the game. The code includes an HTML file for the layout and content of the page, a CSS file for the styles and layout of the page, and a JavaScript file for the logic and interactivity of the game.

- Players can place their ships on their grid in any random variation by clicking on the "Place Ships" button.
- Once they are satisfied with the layout of their ships, the Player can hit the "Continue" button to begin the game.
- Players take turns trying to sink each other's ships by clicking on squares on the opponent's grid.
- Players can see the result of their attacks (hit, miss, or already attacked) on the opponent's grid.
- The game ends when one player sinks all of the other player's ships and the winner is declared.
